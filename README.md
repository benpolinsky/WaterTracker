# WaterTracker

Simple app prototyped with Repl.it. Visualization and analysis of daily water usage.

## Getting Started

`pip install numpy pandas plotly scipy streamlit trafilatura`

## Notes

Repl.it isn't bad. I imagine it used python because I asked for some data-viz/processing/analysis. Got stuck on csv headings for way too long. It had regrouped the data under different columns, but then was attempting to validate against the original names. Not sure it would have ever fixed the issue on its own - I had to debug the code myself - though it did do some print debugging for me.
